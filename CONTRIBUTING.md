# How to contribute

Report any problems with this script as a [new issue](https://github.com/seakintruth/fileshare_connection_test_vbs/issues/new)

## Testing

Tests are performed using the VBA test suite from https://github.com/VBA-tools/vba-test, in the [test excel file](/tests/test.xlsm).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to this repository](https://github.com/seakintruth/fileshare_connection_test_vbs/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces (hard tabs)
  * We attempt to follow the [Reddick VBA (RVBA) Naming Convention](http://www.xoc.net/downloads/rvbanc.pdf) and follow these [VBA coding standards](https://github.com/seakintruth/VBA-Coding-Standards)
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
 
Thanks,
Jeremy Gerdes
