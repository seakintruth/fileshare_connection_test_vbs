# Fileshare Connection Test --- Visual Basic Script
A visual basic script to verify that the network connection to a file share is stable enough (fast and low latency) to open a MS Access database.

To date Microsoft Access databases really can't be run on a fileshare over the internet

# Modify this script for your needs
Look for `[TODO]` comments in the [Config.ini](/app/Config.ini) and [Fileshare-Connection-Test.vbs](/app/Fileshare-Connection-Test.vbs) files
